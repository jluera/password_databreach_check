# password_databreach_check

## This script utilizes the pwnedpasswords API to check if a password has been listed in their data breach records.
- If the password is listed, it will tell you how many times. (So how many different data breaches that password was referenced in.)
- Or it will tell you if the password was not found in its data breach records.

When you run the script via cli, you can enter one or more passwords to check.
